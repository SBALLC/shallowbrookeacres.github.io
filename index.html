      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Shallowbrooke Acres, a small farm in Clarke County, Virginia, providing fresh meats, natural skincare, and handmade goods for our local community.</p>

    <section id="beef" class="card">
      <h2>Beef</h2>
      <p>Our beef comes from certified Angus cattle, raised with care and respect right here on the farm. We focus on quality, not quantity — providing you with richly marbled, flavorful cuts that are perfect for grilling, roasting, or slow cooking. Whether you’re picking up a ribeye for a weekend cookout or stocking your freezer with a quarter or half beef, you’re getting premium meat raised the right way.</p>

    <section id="sausage" class="card">
      <h2>Sausage</h2>
      <p>We specialize in small-batch custom sausage made from both pork and lamb, seasoned and crafted with care. Whether you want something sweet, spicy, or savory, we can tailor the flavor to your liking. Our sausage is perfect for grilling, adding to pasta, or serving up as the star of the meal. Let us know your preference — we’ll make it fresh.</p>

    <section id="bacon" class="card">
      <h2>Bacon</h2>
      <p>There’s nothing like the smell of real, slow-smoked bacon. Our nitrate-free cold smoked bacon is cured and smoked the traditional way, offering rich flavor without additives. Choose from our classic regular cut, peppered bacon, or smoky ham steaks — perfect for breakfast, sandwiches, or that weekend brunch spread. Once you try it, you’ll never go back to store-bought.</p>

    <section id="balm" class="card">
      <h2>Tallow Skin Balm</h2>
      <p>Our tallow skin balm is made in small batches using rendered beef tallow, just the way it’s been done for generations. Tallow is rich in vitamins A, D, E, and K, and closely matches the natural oils in your skin — making it deeply moisturizing and easy to absorb. We keep our ingredient list short and simple, using only natural elements that nourish and protect. Whether you’re dealing with dry hands, rough patches, or just want something you can trust on your skin, this balm is as honest and effective as it gets.</p>

    <section id="candles" class="card">
      <h2>Soy Candles</h2>
      <p>Our handmade soy candles are crafted with care, using only the finest soy wax and natural fragrances. Each candle is poured in small batches, ensuring a clean burn and a subtle, long-lasting scent that fills your home with warmth and comfort. Whether it’s the soothing scent of lavender, the cozy warmth of cinnamon, or a seasonal blend, these candles add that perfect touch to any room.
Note: Our candles are in high demand and currently sold out, but don’t worry — we’re busy crafting more! Sign up to be notified when they’re back in stock.</p>

   <section id="AB" class="card">
      <h2>Apple Butter</h2>
      <p>Our apple butter is slow-cooked over an open fire, just like our ancestors did generations ago. Using fresh, local apples and a time-honored recipe, the result is a rich, dark, spiced spread that tastes like fall in a jar. It’s perfect on toast, biscuits, or as a glaze for meats. Every jar tells a story — and that story starts with fire, patience, and tradition.</p>
