            <h3>Beef Tallow Skincare</h3>
            <p>If cows had hands, they’d probably use this too. Beef tallow isn’t just for cooking—it’s also an ancient, natural skincare secret. We use the purest beef tallow to craft moisturizers, balms, and creams that nourish and hydrate your skin without any harsh chemicals.

Why beef tallow, you ask? It’s packed with vitamins A, D, E, and K, which are known to help repair and rejuvenate the skin. It also has a similar composition to our skin’s natural oils, making it easily absorbed and incredibly effective for dry skin, chapped lips, or just giving your skin a little extra glow.

Our handcrafted tallow products are as simple as they are effective—no frills, no additives, just pure, natural goodness for your skin. Treat yourself to skincare that’s as fresh and real as the farm it came from.</p>

            <h3>Homemade Apple Butter</h3>
            <p>How do we make our apple butter?  Hint: It involves a lot of apples and a lot of love.  Our Homemade Apple Butter is made from the finest, locally sourced apples, slow-cooked to perfection with a blend of warm spices. This rich, smooth spread is a true costumer favorite.</p>
