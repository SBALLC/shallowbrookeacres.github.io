      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>At Shallowbrooke Acres, we are proud to call Clarke County, Virginia our home. Our farm is deeply rooted in the rich agricultural history of this beautiful region, where generations of families have tended the land, raised livestock, and shared the fruits of their labor with the local community.<br><br>

We honor the legacy of the region's farming traditions by cultivating a variety of high-quality, sustainable products that reflect our commitment to the land and the people who rely on it. From certified Angus beef to handmade sausages, nitrate-free bacon, and tallow skin balm, every product we offer is crafted with care and a respect for the heritage that shapes us.<br><br>

Our farm is more than just a place of work; it’s a way of life that ties us to the past while nourishing the future. The rolling hills are not just picturesque — they are filled with history and stories of hard work, family, and community. We take pride in continuing that tradition by providing fresh, local goods that are grown and made with the same dedication that has been passed down through the years.<br><br>

When you purchase from Shallowbrooke Acres, you’re not just supporting a farm — you’re helping preserve the legacy of agriculture in Clarke County and strengthening the local community. We invite you to join us in celebrating this rich heritage by enjoying the very best of what our farm and this beautiful county have to offer.</p>

      <h2>Beef</h2>
      <p>Our beef comes from certified Angus cattle, raised with care and respect right here on the farm. We focus on quality, not quantity — providing you with richly marbled, flavorful cuts that are perfect for grilling, roasting, or slow cooking. <br><br>Whether you’re picking up a ribeye for a weekend cookout or stocking your freezer with a whole, quarter, or half beef, you’re getting premium meat raised the right way.</p>

    <section id="sausage" class="card">
      <h2>Sausage</h2>
      <p>We specialize in small-batch custom sausage made from both pork and lamb, seasoned and crafted with care. <br><br>
        Whether you want something sweet, spicy, or savory, we can tailor the flavor to your liking. Our sausage is perfect for grilling, adding to pasta, or serving up as the star of the meal. Let us know your preference — we’ll make it fresh.</p>

    <section id="bacon" class="card">
      <h2>Bacon</h2>
      <p>There’s nothing like the smell of real, slow-smoked bacon. Our nitrate-free cold smoked bacon is cured and smoked the traditional way, offering rich flavor without additives. <br><br>
        Choose from our classic regular cut, peppered bacon, or smoky ham steaks — perfect for breakfast, sandwiches, or that weekend brunch spread. Once you try it, you’ll never go back to store-bought.</p>

    <section id="balm" class="card">
      <h2>Tallow Skin Balm</h2>
      <p>Our tallow skin balm is made in small batches using rendered beef tallow, just the way it’s been done for generations. <br><br>
        Tallow is rich in vitamins A, D, E, and K, and closely matches the natural oils in your skin — making it deeply moisturizing and easy to absorb. We keep our ingredient list short and simple, using only natural elements that nourish and protect. <br><br>
        Whether you’re dealing with dry hands, rough patches, or just want something you can trust on your skin, this balm is as honest and effective as it gets.</p>

   <section id="AB" class="card">
      <h2>Apple Butter</h2>
      <p>Our apple butter is slow-cooked over an open fire, just like our ancestors did generations ago. Using fresh, local apples and a time-honored recipe, the result is a rich, dark, spiced spread that tastes like fall in a jar. <br><br>
        It’s perfect on toast, biscuits, or as a glaze for meats. Every jar tells a story — and that story starts with fire, patience, and tradition.</p>
